		<div class="project-container">
		<p>Every twenty-something year old (myself included) wants to complain about adulthood—not being prepared and not having their life together only 1/4 of the way into it. For this project, I wanted to design a how-to in an unconventional way. I wanted a how-to that I could relate to and revisit after completion of the project to use to my own benefit.</p>
		<p>My personal goal was to use an unfamiliar medium (JavaScript) and approach the problem in a realistic way. Millennials tend to go straight to the internet anyway, so using JavaScript, I designed and coded a website that every day, introduces a new “adulting” tip, trick, or tutorial, linking to an external source for the viewer to read, watch, and learn. Essentially, if you refer back to this website everyday for a year—or even better, make it your browser’s homepage—you’ll undoubtedly find yourself struggling less and less when faced with the typical tasks of adulthood.</p>

		<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
		<p>Tamed is a family owned male grooming business that was originally established in 1925 as a barbershop based in New York. We closed our shop in 1972 in order to focus solely on our handmade, caffeinated shaving creams, which have become widely known for their energy kick and their ability to steer clear of razor-bumps.</p>
		<p>In celebration of 90 wonderful years, we are re-opening our shop and providing a whole new experience for our loyal patrons.</p>
		<p>We are pairing up with local businesses in our community and encouraging our customers to relax while enjoying complimentary samples from shops located within walking distance. Our goal is to provide a full service grooming bar experience while revolutionizing masculinity in a salon environment. In this liberated atmosphere, we are reshaping the male grooming experience.</p>

					<p>Tamed is a made-up business I’ve created to gain experience in branding a company from scratch—beginning with the broad idea of constructing a male grooming salon and subsequently forming the name, story, and brand guidelines. I designed business cards, a services menu, website, social media campaign, and shipping package for online purchases. Additionally, I designed an invitation package to kick off the collaborative loyalty card program between Tamed and Flora Nest (another local business that I constructed to the extent of the general idea, story and logo), to be mailed to the dearest customers of both businesses.</p>

		<p>As a collaboration with <a href="http://ridahsign.com" target="_blank">Faridah Adam</a>, we designed and constructed a kaleidoscope lamp in order to experiment with the Laser Cutter, CNC Machine, and 3D Printer. There was also one catch: everything printed was to be made up of the same basic shape—a triangle. After collaborative brainstorming and a long list of crazy ideas, I found a rotating light bulb online to take apart and customize. We used each of the machines to our advantage to create the lamp structure and designed 18 patterns to add to the inside of the outer globe for the light to shine through and create the kaleidoscope effect we were looking for.</p>

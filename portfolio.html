		<div class="project-title">Adulting</div>
		
		<div class="project-container"><a name="top"></a>
		<p>Every twenty-something year old (myself included) wants to complain about adulthood—not being prepared enough and not having their life together only 1/4 of the way into it. For this project, I wanted to design a how-to in an unconventional way. I wanted something I could relate to and easily revisit after completion to use for my own benefit.</p>
		<p>My goal was to use an unfamiliar medium and approach the problem in a realistic way. Millennials tend to go straight to the internet anyway, so using JavaScript, I designed and coded a website that every day of the year, introduces a new “adulting” tip, trick, or tutorial, linking to an external source for the viewer to read, watch, and learn. Essentially, if you refer back to this website everyday for a year—or even better, make it your browser’s homepage—you’ll undoubtedly find yourself struggling less and less when faced with the typical tasks of adulthood.</p>

		<p>Tamed is a fictional business I created to experience branding a company entirely from scratch. I started with the broad idea of constructing a male grooming salon and subsequently formed the name, story, and brand guidelines. I designed business cards, a services menu, website, social media campaign, and shipping package for online purchases. Additionally, I designed an invitation package to kick off the collaborative loyalty card program between Tamed and Flora Nest (another fictional business that I constructed the general idea, story and logo for), to be mailed to the dearest customers of both businesses.</p>

		<p><b>Our Story</b></p>
		<p>Tamed is a family owned male grooming business that was originally established in 1925 as a barbershop based in New York. We closed our shop in 1972 in order to focus solely on our handmade, caffeinated shaving creams, which have become widely known for their energy kick and their ability to steer clear of razor-bumps.</p>
		<p>In celebration of 90 wonderful years, we are re-opening our shop and providing a whole new experience for our loyal patrons.</p>
		<p>We are pairing up with local businesses in our community and encouraging our customers to relax while enjoying complimentary samples from shops located within walking distance. Our goal is to provide a full service grooming bar experience while revolutionizing masculinity in a salon environment. In this liberated atmosphere, we are reshaping the male grooming experience.</p>

		<div class="project-container"><a name="top"></a>
		<p>As a collaboration with <a href="http://ridahsign.com" target="_blank">Faridah Adam</a>, we designed and constructed a kaleidoscope lamp in order to experiment with the Laser Cutter, CNC Machine, and 3D Printer. There was also one catch: everything printed was to be made up of the same basic shape—a triangle. After collaborative brainstorming and a long list of crazy ideas, I found a rotating light bulb online to take apart and customize. We used each of the machines to our advantage to create the lamp structure and designed 18 patterns to add to the inside of the outer globe for the light to shine through and create the kaleidoscope effect we were looking for.</p>

		<p>“Tasteful Collecting” is my subtle way of confessing that I’m—let’s just face it—a hoarder. But unlike the compulsive disorder we see on television with (in the most serious of cases) dead cats buried under years and years of trash, I use my hoarding habits to my creative advantage. This foldable guide breaks down the difference between actual hoarding and smart hoarding, essentially taking your recyclables and using them for storage, decoration, DIY, etc. For my guide, I created an original pattern and a map with effective examples from photographs of actual items you can find in my room.</p>
